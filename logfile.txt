I created navigation across multiple pages using react router (refer to resources posted in backend/frontend channel).

Currently trying to figure out how to implement an internal link in home.js and hide our navigation from our welcoming
screens.

- Moved our initial loading screen to Welcome.js located in src/components. 
This is so this is seperate from the pages that contain navigation.
- Currently figuring out how to seperate the welcoming screen from screens that contain navigation.
- There also seems to be a weird issue with error.js loading when the browser starts up, although the router has it set to load welcome.js
when the user first visits the app. I'm getting no console log errors for this.

- archived react router navigation to implement login system
- login system fully implemented with sign up/sign in/ log out details
- organized structure of files, screens are now located in src/pages, fire.js is in components folder.
- working on changing the structure of navigation so that navigation can be hidden from specific components.
