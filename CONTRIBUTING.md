<p>Follow the directions of the links for whichever program you are using, wether it's <b>Sourcetree or Github Desktop.</b> Also take in account the type of operating
system you are using <b>(Mac or Windows).</b></p>
<h2> Forking </h2>
<p>You're going to want to fork the repo before doing anything else in Github browser (This process is the same for everyone).</p>

<h2> Creating a Branch </h2>
<p>ðŸ›‘ I insist that everyone does this to better organize the pull requests you make. ðŸ›‘ This allows you to make changes without directly affecting the master repo. 
<p><b>âš Make sure to follow the resources that apply to your operating system and choice of repository management.âš </b></p>

<h2> Pulling Changes from Repo </h2>
<p>ðŸ›‘ It is crucial you do this from the <b>cloned repo, <i>not</i> the forked repo. ðŸ›‘</b> Remember to do this <b>before</b> making any changes to files. By making a pull, you are grabbing the latest changes from the repo. There will be conflicts merging if you decide to make edits before making a pull. </p> 
<p><b>âš Make sure to follow the resources that apply to your operating system and choice of repository management.âš </b></p>

<h3>Windows/Mac Sourcetree</h3>

<p><b>Step 1)</b> Click where it says pull at the top.</p>

<p><b>Step 2)</b> "Pull from remote:" should always say origin/main, "Remote branch to pull:" should always say origin/main, and where it says "Pull into local branch:" should say the branch you are working on. In my case the local branch I am working on is "mikayla-develop". Make sure the branch you are working on is your created branch name. "Commit merged changes immediately" should always be checked.</p>

<p><b>Step 3)</b> Click "pull" and the latest changes from the repo should be in your local folder on your desktop. Make sure to double check.</p>
